Requirements:
1. Each tab should show relevant data based on the status of the campaign (upcoming, live, past).
2. The very first column should show the time diff from today to that campaign's date. (You can
consider any date. If the date is in the future, you can show the number of days in the future. For
example, "23 days ahead")
3. Add functionality to reschedule a campaign by opening a calendar on clicking the Schedule again
icon. (Whatever date you select, should be shown in the first column named "Date". The time diff
shown against it should also be updated).
4. Once the date is changed of campaign. The campaign should move to the relevant Tab
(Upcoming,Live,Past) , based on the date selected.
5. Clicking on View Pricing in the row should show a modal with relevant information of the
campaign. See the design in the Specs section below
6. The entire UI should be responsive. Please use your judgement on how it should look on mobile
devices
7. Please use dummy json to populate the table. For reference you can see the Need Help? section
below
8. You should use a modern frontend framework like ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS etc to implement
this.
9. It should support basic localization of strings in 2 languages. There should
be a button to select between different languages.
